        <p>
          Art is one of the greatest gifts of the universe. They say "beauty is
          in the eye of the beholder" and so I create and interpret art in the
          way it impacts my perspective. For instance, I've recently finished a
          personal artistic project that was inspired by my love for nature
          along with some introspective observations. Take a look!

            <td>
              Deep Loyalty, Solitude, Instict-Trusting. The black and white
              highlight the ying-yang relationship in this sector whereas the gray
              represents the "gray area" from external circumstances.

          <tr>

            <td>Physical</td>
            <td>
              Sleek Frame, Swift Movement, Protective. Contrary to usual connotation
              of a snake, the Cobra to me is less about morality and more aligned
              with its movement in juxtoposition to other animals.
            </td>
            <td>
              The "Real Love" caption is a nod to a heart-shaped birthmark I have
              behind my left shoulder.

          <tr>
            <td>Owl</td>
            <td>Mental</td>
            <td>
              Observant, Independent Thinking, Esoteric Curiousity. Most owls are
              nocturnal, meaning they become active when the sun is down. No I'm not
              nocturnal but I do some of my deepest, most reflective thinking in the
              nighttime.
            </td>
            <td>
              The "and still I rose" caption is a nod to both Maya Angelou's 'Still
              I Rise' poem and the song "Interlude by J Cole" (the song that was
              playing as I was drawing) where he references her poem.

            <td>Spiritual</td>
            <td>
              Rebirth, Renaissance, Regeneration. All around the Phoenix is a
              chamber of burning flames and ether. No matter how much tension builds
              up in the prior sectors, self knowledge and awareness allows me to
              return evolved.
            </td>
            <td>
              The same flames that are made to destroy the bird, are simultaneously
              the catalyst for its development.
