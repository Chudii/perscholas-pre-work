        <p>
          Since I was in middle school, I've always had a passion for coding.
          The idea of being able to speak the langauge of computers in order to
          produce an expected output, over time, has compelled me to integrate
          it into my future aspirations. I was born in Newark, NJ and am the son
          of Nigerian natives. I am an explorerer of art, adventure, and
          achievement. So whether it be drawing, painting, bikeriding,
          nature-hiking, dancing, just know I've had my stake in it all. Am I
          any good at them? Well... thats a story for another time.

        <h3 class="brown">Where It Began</h3>
        <p class="brown">
          During the final months of my last year of middle school, my science
          teacher integrated a Computer Science course on the side. In that
          class, we would learn simple coding concepts, but it was in this class
          where I realized the amount of fun I could have by being given a
          puzzle that I could decipher with commands.

        <h3 class="navy">My Goals For the Future</h3>
        <p class="navy">
          Throughout the summer of 2022 into the fall, I will be undertaking a
          course where I am able to solidify my technical knowledge when it comes
          to programming in an immersive academic experience. I plan on
          becomming a Software Engineer and creating useful tools and code to
          assist in making the lives of modern people easier and hopefully
          better.
